Advice for FluidDyn developers
==============================

Fluiddyn has been designed to be used by scientists-developers. Thus, you may
have to modify the code of the FluidDyn packages.  So I would advice to work
"as a developer", i.e. to get the source code and to use revision control and
the development mode of the Python installer.

For FluidDyn, we use the revision control software Mercurial and the main
repository is hosted `here <https://bitbucket.org/fluiddyn/fluiddyn>`_ in
Bitbucket. We advice to fork this repository (click on "Fork") and to clone
your newly created repository to get the code on your computer (click on
"Clone" and run the command that will be given). If you are new with Mercurial
and Bitbucket, you can also read this short tutorial:

We present a tool to handle the different FluidDyn repositories.
