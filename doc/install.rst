Installation and advice
=======================

Advice on Python
----------------

FluidDyn should be used also by scientists that are not experienced in
Python. We provide some advice on how to work with Python and how to
get a good Python environment:

Dependencies
------------

It is strongly recommended to install `NumPy
<http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html>`_ and `Matplotlib
<http://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html>`_ before installing FluidDyn.

FluidDyn also depends on `psutil
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/psutil>`_, but it will be automatically
installed during the installation of FluidDyn so you do not actually
care.

FluidDyn also used some other packages for some particular tasks, as
in particular Scipy and h5py. Since they can be difficult to get for
some small hardware, they are not considered as real dependencies, but
be prepared to get ImportError if you try to do something using these
packages without them.


Basic installation
------------------

FluidDyn can be installed from the Python Package Index by the command::

  pip install fluiddyn --pre

The ``--pre`` option of pip allows the installation of a pre-release version.

You can also download the source-code and run::

  python setup.py install

Install in development mode
---------------------------

FluidDyn is still in beta version ("testing for users"). Moreover, it has been
designed to be used by scientists-developers. Thus, you may have to modify the
code or even write a new class in the package.  So I would advice to work "as a
developer", i.e. to get the source code and to use revision control and the
development mode of the Python installer.

For FluidDyn, I use the revision control software Mercurial and the
main repository is hosted `here
<https://bitbucket.org/fluiddyn/fluiddyn>`_ in Bitbucket. I would
advice to fork this repository (click on "Fork") and to clone your
newly created repository to get the code on your computer (click on
"Clone" and run the command that will be given). If you are new with
Mercurial and Bitbucket, you can also read this short tutorial:

.. toctree::

   mercurial_bitbucket

If you really don't want to use Mercurial, you can also just manually
download the package from `the Bitbucket page
<https://bitbucket.org/fluiddyn/fluiddyn>`__ or from `the PyPI page
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fluiddyn>`__.

The development mode is often very convenient. From the root directory
of the project, run::

  python setup.py develop

After the installation, it is a good practice to run the unit tests by
running ``python -m unittest discover`` from the root directory or
from any of the "test" directories.
