Welcome to FluidDyn's documentation!
====================================

The project FluidDyn aims at promoting the use of open-source Python
software in research in fluid dynamics.  The project provides some
Python packages specialized for different tasks, in particular
`fluidlab <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fluidlab>`_ for doing
experiments in the laboratory and `fluidsim
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fluidsim>`_ for running numerical
simulations.

The project is still in a planning stage so it is still
pretty unstable and many of its planned features have not yet been
implemented.

This documentation presents the project FluidDyn and the package of
the same name, which is the base package on which the other packages
depend on. For the specific documentations of these specialized
packages, follow these links:

- `fluidsim documentation <http://pythonhosted.org/fluidsim/>`_
- `fluidlab documentation <http://pythonhosted.org/fluidlab/>`_
